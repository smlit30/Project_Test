## Results Summary

While the Ensemble classification seemed to product the highest accuracy score in the models.  The overall decision to use these would need further review by the comapny to see how much it would cost to be wrong vs the benefit of having models like these make the decisions.  If the cost is too high for a false positive, approved loan on a bad/risky application, and if the opportunity cost on a false negative is also a bad results.
