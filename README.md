# School Performance Metrics

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to analyze which factors are most strongly correlated with student performance.  To get into the details here lets define what we consider performance for the students, the group of students analyzed and the data itself.    

In this review performance will simply be how students scored on standardized testing on SAT, Math & ELA performance scores.  

The group of students included in the data from the Illinois State Board of education data as linked to below.

The defintions for each factor tested are listed at the bottom of this page. 

Lastly the machine learning alogrithm testing will be detialed out as follows in this section.

## Visuals for this Project
Our first visuals includeda layout of zip codes with their proficiency % of ELA & Math scores.

These next visuals show ELA & Math proficiency of different schools with the average admin salary and vs teach salary as the Y axis.
